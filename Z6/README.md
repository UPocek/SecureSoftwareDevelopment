### Task 4
- First I read the message and saw that some parts were repeating and didn't make sense, this led me to believe that this was encoded text
- Then I used Google's phrase match search term using quotes (for example "search_term") and found a Chinese blog that led me to Spam Mimic https://www.spammimic.com/decode.cgi
- I copied spam email content sent to me by my friend, decoded it, and saw the flag
- UNS{EM4IL_5P4M_AG4N?}

### Task 5
- I opened forgotten_passwords and started looking for answers
- First answer about FTN I found at http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/n1613077170/o-ftn-u that FTN was opened on <strong>18/05/1960</dtrong> which gave me correct hash
The second answer I found after a little bit of research on the FTN website. This information is not available on Wikipedia, but I found that the dean at that time was <strong>Dragutin</strong> ZelenoviÄ‡ here http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/n508315396/istorijat-funkcije-dekan
The third answer I found searching through the archive of FTN website posts. Here http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/1426608662/arhiva-vesti I found that announcement about website was made on <strong>18/05/2005</strong>
The fourth answer I found on http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/n1613077170/o-ftn-u where every program's start date is mentioned, answer is <strong>1999</strong>
- Then I was able to unzip rar protected with a password on https://www.ezyzip.com/open-password-protected-rar-files.html
- UNS{V3RY_OLD_4RCH1V3}

### Task 6
- I figured out that flag must be hidden somewhere inside the image so I first tried opening the image in a text editor to see if the flag was appended to the end of the image as text, but it wasn't
- Then I opened the image as a byte array to see if I could find an image like that with the same premise that the flag is text, but that didn't help either, after careful research about Steganography I figured that secret could be an image embedded in an image
- Now the task is to find an online tool that isn't looking for hidden text but hidden image inside the image and I found it here https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide, decoding image gave me a flag as an image
- UNS{PMF_STUD3NT5_LOV3_M4TH}

### Task 7
 - A Google search for The Queen of the Ocean first led me to cruise ship, but that didn't make much sense in the context of captured and tagged. So I added those keywords and found out that the Queen in this context is a great white shark.
 - I googled and found out that they gave her name Nakumi
 - I also found that this website https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/detail/nukumi has ping information for tagged sharks fo I searched for Nukumi and found that she was tagged on Apr 11, 2021, 3:03:07 PM so the flag is
